# TicTacToe

## Project Description
A Tic Tac Toe game developed using SwiftUI. The game features a smart AI system to present a challenge for the player. This was developed for learning purposes.

## Features
* Play TicTacToe against an AI with three different difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard mode.
* On Easy mode, the AI just chooses random squares.
* On Normal mode, the AI chooses random squares and goes for winning moves if it has any.
* On Hard mode, the AI goes for winning moves if it has any, blocks the player's winning moves, takes the middle square if it is available, and then chooses random squares.
* Clean UI designed in SwiftUI.
* Alerts presented to the screen describing the difficulties, a loss, win and draw for the game.
* The game keeps track of your previous difficulty to let you keep playing on it.
* Score that updates on the screen every time someone wins a game.
* Board automatically resets whenever you switch difficulties or the game ends.
* Score does not transfer over between difficulties, it is reset every time you move to a different difficulty (no cheating!).

## TODO
* Possibly add a 2 Human Player mode.
* Add an option to let the user choose if they want to place X or O.

## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/atorresruiz8/TicTacToe
* Must be on MacOS and have Xcode installed.
* In TicTacToe folder, open the TicTacToe.xcodeproj project file.
* Build the project and run the app on a simulator, or iPhone.

## Usage
> Install the app onto either your simulator or iPhone by running the build command.
> You can choose between Easy, Normal, or Hard mode on the bottom of the screen.
> You can then start the game by choosing any of the nine grid spaces to place an X on.
> Play until you either win, lose, or end in a draw.
> Keep playing on the same difficulty you were on, or change to another one.
